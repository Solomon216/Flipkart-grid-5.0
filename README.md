# Flipkart-grid-5.0

Overview
This project showcases a 5-axis robotic arm designed for picking and placing packages. The system utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for efficient object detection, servo motors for precise movement, and a Raspberry Pi for control and coordination.

Features
5-Axis Movement: The robotic arm is capable of precise 5-axis movement for versatile applications.

Object Detection with YOLO: YOLO is employed for real-time object detection, enabling the robotic arm to identify and interact with packages effectively.

Raspberry Pi Control: The Raspberry Pi serves as the brain of the system, providing a platform for programming and controlling the robotic arm.
